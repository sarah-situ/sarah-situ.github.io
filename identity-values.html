    <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h3>
        1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
        how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
        you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
      <p>
        This was a long time ago but when I used to work at a supermarket. I
        came across a situation where I was cleaning and had found money whilst
        cleaning the inside of a conveyor belt.<br />
        This money would’ve been sitting inside for an unknown amount of time.
        <br />There was no way to find the owner. I had given the money to my
        manager at the time to put aside if someone had some to claim at some
        point and if not, if it was put in one of those donation boxes.<br /><br />
        Thinking back to this situation I think part of my younger self I
        would’ve wanted to keep it but ultimately I’m glad I had handed it
        in.<br />
        I would’ve felt uncomfortable with the decision to keep it as it’s not
        mine whether there is an owner to claim it or not.<br />
        In reflection it made me think about how much I value honestly in others
        and in myself.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
        your values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am very close with my family, so my family and friends are important
        to me. <br />I grew up in a chinese household where we didn't really say
        "I love you" but I knew I was loved through actions and all the amazing
        homecooked food growing up.<br />I try to be kind to others where I can,
        you never know what people are going through.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Based on a couple of online surveys, hope is one of my top strengths.
        Which I think is true, I try to be optimistic and look for the best in
        other and situations.<br />I will try to use this strength to focus on
        good things to come on my learning journey for the next few months and
        not be discouraged when it gets tough or frustrating.<br />
        I am also hard working and a great team player which will help with
        working with others in a team in future projects.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think coming from a background of very little programming may make my
        learning journey very frustrating at certain points or feel like I don’t
        know enough when I finish the end of my study.<br />
        This might make me feel discouraged but learning new ideas takes time
        and patience.
      </p>
      <h3>
        5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension.<br />
        Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
        your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I had a disagreement with a coworker over a presentation that we were
        both working on together to present to customer and were given a short
        time frame to complete so it was a somewhat stressful situation.<br />
        We had differences in how to present the data and couldn't agree on the
        final product. We went over the presentation and data together to
        discuss and work out changes to implement that we were happy with.<br />
        In the end we were able to compromise and work together to make the
        presentation sucessful. <br />Reflecting back on this situation, I wish
        we had come up with a plan together on how we would approach the
        presentation. <br />I think that would’ve minimised the conflict we had.
        I will try to take this approach for future projects to plan and clearly
        define the goals and objectives.
