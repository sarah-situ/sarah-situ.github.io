        ### • Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity
        benefits people. Neuroplasticity is the process where the brain forms
        new neurons and create new pathways with these neurons. In response to
        learning, these new neural pathways are the brain’s way of changing and
        organising new information to build further connections. While at a
        younger age we tend to be more responsive to learning and this is the
        period where the brain has a rapid ground in neurons and there are
        around 15,000 connections(synapses)(2) per neurons in the brains of an
        average three year old. As an average adult we have half of these
        numbers, because as we age we experience something called synaptic
        pruning. This is because we gain new experiences, we build and
        strengthen connections and some are removed. However neuroplasticity is
        an ongoing process and everyone can benefit from it. Brain development
        does not stop after early childhood, but it is the foundation upon which
        the brain continues developing. (3). The brain is adaptable and
        continues to change throughout our lives. The more we practice
        something, the brain continues to strengthen and build new pathways for
        a new habit or if you are learning a new language. **10 Principles of
        Neuroplasticity: Part 1**

        is also the mechanism,to repeat the learned
        behavior](https://www.cfimove.org/10-principles-of-neuroplasticity-part-1/#:~:text=It%20is%20also%20the%20mechanism,to%20repeat%20the%20learned%20behavior).

        might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.

        Knowing that fact that you can change your brain, you can learning
        something new with some repetition and patience is helpful. This website
        talks about how there are five components to a neuroplastic change. 1.
        Challenge & Novelty You look for a skill that is new to you and not too
        easy to learn. We need a certain degree of challenge for cognitive
        change. For me that would be learning software development at Dev
        Academy. I have no prior background in this area and it is big learning
        curve, however I am constantly learning and being challenged. 2.
        Intention The skill you are practicing / learning must have some level
        of importance to you. Neuoplastic change is associated with 3. Specific
        Attention Have a plan and schedule time to give this task your focus.
        Giving specific focus to your new skill can increase higher changes of
        change. Setting goals is along the way is helpful. 4. Repetition &
        Intensity Making sure you following your plan, having constant
        repetition (and upper the intensity if required) is needed to creating
        new connections. 5. Time Giving yourself time for the change to occur.
        It is normal for you to lose focus, be patient and adjust your plan and
        keep on going. ## • What are some of the ways to increase your
        neuroplasticity? Some things that can increase neuroplasticity: -
        Exercise - Mediation - Learning a new skill (eg a new language, hobby) -
        Making/ listening to music - Travel

        ## 2. Researching Growth Mindset ## Discuss what it is and why it is
        relevant. Growth mindset is the belief that learning and abilities is
        not set in stone. People with this mindset see challenges as a goal,
        skills can be learnt, set back can be overcome with time. ## In this
        exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?

        ## How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?Link
        to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
        https://www.understood.org/en/articles/growth-mindset One thing I've
        learnt is that growth mindset is not just about being positive. Learning
        from feedback, experience and finding ways to improve. Praise also
        doesn't build this mindset, it is where we praise,eg how a problem was
        solved and not how success they are. **Myth 2: Growth mindset is about
        being positive.** It’s more than that. Growth mindset means taking
        feedback, learning from experience, and coming up with strategies for
        improving. **Myth 3: Praise builds a growth mindset.** It
        depends *what* you’re praising. The important thing is how a person
        approached a challenge, not how hard they worked, or how successful they
        were. ## **Blend with your learning plan and strategies** ## Reflect and
        discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning
        plan and strategy. It’s important to remember that setbacks can actually
        provide a way forward.
