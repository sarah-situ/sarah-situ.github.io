    <h2>Learning Plan</h2>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway</h3>
      <p>
        Find a career in the software development industry when I finish up at
        Dev Academy. I know that there many areas you can go into.<br>
        I hope I can discover my niche and find work at place where I have more flexibility and continue
        to grow in my learning.<br />
        Not too sure what projects I want to work in the future yet.<br />
        Maybe developing and working on applications or apps where I am helping
        communities grow or a service that is meaningful and improves people’s
        lives.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some strengths I have are that I am a patience person and if I have my
        eyes set on a task I can be quite determined to finish it.<br />
        I am pretty optimistic and try to see the best in all situations.<br />
        I think it is important to shift our mindset to see the good to help us
        more confident and happy, but also it doesn’t mean we completely ignore
        reality.</p>
        <p>
        Limitations: Not as confident to say something when I don’t know the
        answer or struggling.<br />I can be caught up with something because I
        want it to be perfect.<br />
        I need to embrace “Done is better than perfect” because there is always
        room for improvement.</p>
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        - how to communicate better with others and be more engaging to relate -
        Be more creative - Try to be more curious and ask questions in general
      </p>

      <h3>
        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        <br />This should include:<br />
        <h4>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </h4>
      </h3>
      <p>
        To make sure that I am working productively throughout the course I will
        be more strict in reinforcing the time blocks suggested for each task.<br>
        Try to take breaks often between studying and to plan my week and work
        around personal commitments.<br>
        Work out what days I will work on a certain
        section of the sprint and make sure I’m putting in the suggested hours of
        work required each week.<br>
        Make sure I’m also looking after myself getting enough sleep to reduce stress so I can be at my best to
        learn and engage with the other learners, facilitators and people around
        me.
      </p>

      <h4>
        - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
        you
      </h4>
      <p>
        Assess what is the best solution: If I am behind on sprint material,
        contact facilitator for an extension or advice for recommendation on how
        to approach.<br />
        Prioritise the most important tasks. Prioritise mental health, sleep and
        nutrition.<br />
        Consider dropping some personal commits that are less important as a
        last resort for the time being to focus on myself.
      </p>
      <h3>
        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        If I'm struggling with a material I will seek help from the facilitators
        or the other students on the discord channel.<br />
        Setting a time limit when I am struggling with a problem and being aware
        so I can take a break or ask others for help.<br />
        Seek information or tutorials online if no one is available.
      </p>
      <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        To be understanding that we are learning new content at a considerably
        fast pace and sometimes we don’t know what to ask because we don’t
        know.<br />
        Try to guide us when we ask for help for a question or trying to
        understand a concept.<br />
        Be supportive and friendly; which has been so far, and everyone on the
        channel is super responsive and engaging.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.<br />
        For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs.
        It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I don’t have any major commitments so I am pretty flexible during this
        period.<br />
        I do have dance classes that I try to attend weekly and running or
        workout sessions that I have throughout the week.<br />
        I will try keep these personal commitments as I believe it is important
        to have a balance of study and personal life.
