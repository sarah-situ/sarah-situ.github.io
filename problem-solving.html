      <h2>Reflection on Problem Solving</h2>
      <h3>1. A time you were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      <p>
        <em>What was the problem?</em><br />I was stuck on a JavaScript problem
        called deBee during Sprint 4. Actually I don’t think it was really a
        simple problem but the concepts and syntax of JavaScript are still a bit
        foreign and a big learning curve for me at the moment. The deBee problem
        is a sentence with words like ‘buzz’, in both lower case and uppercase.
        For this problem we had to remove all the ‘buzz’ words in the sentence.
      </p>
      <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
      <p>
        I’m still getting into using pseudocode but tried to use it when I
        remember but I did use a pen and paper to write down key points and
        words. Brainstorming ideas on paper about the way I could solve the
        question, see it visually helped me understand what the questions were
        trying ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the pseudocode/ scribbling on paper - Reading out the
        question to a “Rubber ducky” was surprisingly helpful. I think it helps
        your brain process the information in a different way, similar to seeing
        it visually and the brain tries to connect it to the information you
        already know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading the error messages and the test code helped me see what I was
        missing, gave me an idea of what the solution was.
      </p>
      <p>Google - It was great on researching for foundation of the methods.</p>
      <h4>How did I feel throughout the process?</h4>
      <p>
        To be honest this week has been a bit of a rollercoaster of feelings
        working through the sprint 4 Kata. Sometimes it felt very frustrating
        because I was very close in solving the problem. Then there was the
        lightbulb moment and feelings of relief when I finally the answer.
      </p>
      <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
      <p>
        To stay resilient and don’t give up. Sometimes you need a break from the
        questions and somehow the answer makes sense. Time away gives the brain
        a break and then you see the solution.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Time where I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      <p>
        <em>What was the problem?</em><br />On a JavaScript problem, called
        capitalize. The problem requires you to take an all lowercase sentence
        and modify that sentence to have the first letter of each word in that
        sentence to be capitalized.
      </p>
      <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
      <p>
        I googled JavaScript Methods to understand them better and how I could
        apply them to this question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying something - With some knowledge of the methods, I tried typing
        out what I thought would work
      </p>
      <p>
        Console.logging - To see what result was showing up.how did you feel
        throughout the process? - I think this was a less complex question so I
        didn’t feel too stressed out when trying to solve it. - what did you
        learn? - Problems are easier to solve when it is broken down into
        smaller parts.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Pseudocode - I’m still getting used to moving on from using paper and
        pen to writing pseudocode. When I'm writing on paper it's not always
        coherent or makes sense so I'm trying to get into the habit of writing a
        simple plan of attack on problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying something - It's a work in progress, it's tough to find a
        starting point in a problem sometimes when you don’t understand it
        fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rubber ducky method - A method that I like using. Helped me to
        understand the question better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading error messages I didn’t always understand the error messages but
        I used them in conjunction with the test page. I used them as a guide to
        see how close I was to solving the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Console.logging - I found it helpful to use console.log() to see what my
        code was printing. There was some points where I didn’t know how to
        print the code. Sometimes things were not written correctly and couldn’t
        get it to console.log.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google - I felt like this was good resource if I could figure out the
        right keywords, but it also required a lot time to shift through the
        materials available online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking your peers and coaches for help - Definitely work in progress,
        needs work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improving your process with reflection - I don’t do this enough, because
        I feel like I take longer to complete the sprint for each week and when
        I finish the work I'm tired and its already time to start the next
        week’s work. I might try to jot down some key words in a diary next
        time.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
        made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I don’t feel confident enough to ask my peers or coaches for help during
        Sprint 4 because I'm so used to solving problems on my own. I need to
        get out of that headspace and recognise when I'm completely stuck and
        ask for help.
