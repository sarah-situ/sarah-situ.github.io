      <h2>
        • Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the process where the brain forms new neurons and
        create new pathways with these neurons. In response to learning, these
        new neural pathways are the brain’s way of changing and organising new
        information to build further connections. While at a younger age we tend
        to be more responsive to learning and this is the period where the brain
        has a rapid growth in neurons.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an average adult we have half of these numbers, because as we age we
        experience something called synaptic pruning. This is because we gain
        new experiences, we build and strengthen connections and some are
        removed. However neuroplasticity is an ongoing process and everyone can
        benefit from it. Brain development does not stop after early childhood,
        but it is the foundation upon which the brain continues developing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brain is adaptable and continues to change throughout our lives. The
        more we practice something, the brain continues to strengthen and build
        new pathways for a new habit or if you are learning a new language.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h2>
        • Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
        for your benefit.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Knowing that fact that you can change your brain, you can learning
        something new with some repetition and patience is helpful.<br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>1. Challenge & Novelty</h3>
      <p>
        You look for a skill that is new to you and not too easy to learn. We
        need a certain degree of challenge for cognitive change.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Intention</h3>
      <p>
        The skill you are practicing / learning must have some level of
        importance to you.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Specific Attention</h3>
      <p>
        Have a plan and schedule time to give this task your focus. Giving
        specific focus to your new skill can increase higher changes of change.
        Setting goals is along the way is helpful.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Repetition & Intensity</h3>
      <p>
        Making sure you following your plan, having constant repetition (and
        upper the intensity if required) is needed to creating new connections.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Time</h3>
      <p>
        Giving yourself time for the change to occur. It is normal for you to
        lose focus, be patient and adjust your plan and keep on going.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h2>• What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>
        Some things that can increase neuroplasticity:<br />• Exercise<br />•
        Mediation<br />• Learning a new skill (eg a new language, hobby)<br />
        • Making/ listening to music<br />• Travel<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h2>What is Growth Mindset and why is it important?</h2>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is the belief that learning and abilities is not set in
        stone. People with this mindset see challenges as a goal, skills can be
        learnt, set back can be overcome with time.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      <p>
        **Myth 1: Growth mindset is about being positive.** It’s more than that.
        Growth mindset means taking feedback, learning from experience, and
        coming up with strategies for improving.
      </p>
      <p>
        **Myth 2: Praise builds a growth mindset.** It depends *what* you’re
        praising. The important thing is how a person approached a challenge,
        not how hard they worked, or how successful they were.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I've learnt is that growth mindset is not just about being
        positive. It is also learning from feedback, experience and finding ways
        to improve. Praise also doesn't build this mindset, but it is what we
        choose to praise,eg how well a problem was solved and not how smart they
        are.
      </p>
      <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
      <p>
        I will try to take in everything I've learnt about the growth mindset
        during my learning. Particularly not being discouraged when feel stuck
        or have a setback. It’s important to remember that setbacks can actually
        provide a way forward. To embrace the not yet learning mindset that
        Carol Dweck had talked about in research about mindsets.
