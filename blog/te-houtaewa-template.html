    <h3>10 November 2010</h3>

    <p class="about-section">
      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
      his peoples enemies.<br />
      One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked
      Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He
      agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
      <br /><br />
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
      he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there.
      <br />Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind,
      completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety
      Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly.<br />
      On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka
      (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill
      Whangatauatia.
      <br />
      <br />
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted
      stealing the kai (food).<br />
      He was immediately recognised.
