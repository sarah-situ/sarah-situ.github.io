    <h1>JavaScript & DOM</h1>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>
        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
      </h2>
      <p>
        Think of the relationship of JavaScript with HTML and CSS as a house.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h3>
      <p>
        HTML is like the building plan of a house, it contains instructions for
        the overall structure and layout of a webpage. It makes up the roof, all
        the rooms, walls, doors and windows. Similar to elements on the webpage,
        headings, paragraphs and images.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
      <p>
        CSS is the designer who provides all the decorations and styling to the
        house. Things like colour, backgrounds, fonts and spacing are generally
        styled by CSS to HTML and gives a webpage its aesthetic appearance and
        layout.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>JavaScript (JS)</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the extra part that brings the house together. JS is
        responsible for adding in functionality and responsiveness in webpages.
        Things like electricity, ability to turn the lights on and off, running
        hot water are functional components that make the house more interactive
        for the users.
      </p>
      <h2>Control flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow is the order in which a program (code) is executed. Your
        computer runs the code from top to bottom until it finishes unless it
        hits certain statements in the code. Loops allows you to repeat a block
        of code multiple times until a condition is true. It is an effective way
        to reuse the same code to perform recurring tasks
      </p>
      <p>
        A real life example would be for bus routes. The bus driver will follow
        a schedule and a specific route that has multiple stops. The bus will
        stop at each bus stop on his designated schedule and continue (loop)
        until a condition is met, such as the final destination (the last bus
        stop) or when they finish their work shift.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>The DOM ( Document Object Model )</h2>
      <p>
        Is a structural view of the hierarchy of the components that make the
        webpage. To interact with the DOM we can use JavaScript to change HTML
        elements on the webpage. You can use a tool called “Chrome Developer
        Tools console” to access the document object. Javascript can be used to
        manipulate the HTML elements to add styling to the webpage.<br />
        E.g We can change the colour of the text of a certain element via the
        Chrome Developer Tools.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
      <p>
        An array is a sorted list with similar data. The data listed in the
        array are numbered starting from "0" and we use the number to retrieve
        the data we want. If you were to add another item to the list, it would
        be added to the end because arrays are strict with the order they are
        listed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects is also a collection of different datasets in containers Like a
        set of drawers, each drawer can contain various types of data and to
        retrieve the data, you can use the label associated with the drawer.
      </p>

      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are a block of code designed to perform a task or action. They
        are helpful because you can use the same code to do specific tasks
        without rewriting the code again.
