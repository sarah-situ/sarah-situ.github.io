        Hi I'm Sarah! I'm from Wellington. <br />
        I did a BSc in Microbiology and worked in a lab for awhile doing food
        testing.<br />
        Decided it was not the career I wanted to move forward in and here I am,
        in a career change!<br />
        <br />In my spare time you can either find me outside going for a run,
        dancing salsa or reading. These some of things that make me happy.
        <br />I like trying new things and setting little goals to keep me going
        through the year.<br /><br />
        This blog is going to be dedicated to my learning journey at Dev Academy
        and becoming a future software developer.
        <br />
        Thanks for reading!
