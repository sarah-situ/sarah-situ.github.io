    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to manage your own emotions and
        also understand the emotions of the people around you.
      </p>
      <h3>There are five key elements to Emotional Intelligence:</h3>

      <h3>Self-awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Being able to identify how you are feeling, how those feelings affect to
        yourself, the situation and others. Being aware helps you
        to identify why you or someone is behaving in a certain way. Self awareness is also knowing
        your strengths and weaknesses.
      </p>

      <h3>Self-regulation</h3>
      <p>
        To be able to self-regulate allows you to avoid making impulsive
        decisions. You are able to think more clearly and objectively compared
        to if you make you a rash decision based on your feelings at the time.
      </p>

      <h3>Motivation and Empathy</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding others with empathy and understanding is a crucial part of
        teamwork. Being empathetic is important to building relationships and
        making others feel heard. Empathy can motivate prosocial behaviour(
        actions that improve the lives of others). People with high emotional
        intelligence are motivated by internal rewards(goals), action-orientated
        and are always searching ways to improve.
      </p>

      <h3>Social Skills</h3>
      <p>
        To be able to interact well with others is an important emotional
        intelligence skill. These include active listening, verbal and nonverbal
        communication skills that allow you to build meaningful relationships
        and interactions.
      </p><br>
      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        EQ (Emotional quotient) is the ability to understand emotions in
        yourself and in other people.<br> It is also the ability to use that
        knowledge to empathise and communicate well with others.</p>
        <p>IQ (Intelligence quotient) relates to your cognitive and intellectual
        skills, using logic to solve problems, to learn and grasps new
        information and ideas.</p><br>

        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>Having EQ is important because it helps you to build strong relationships, personal and professional. 

          To be able to understand the behaviour of others can give insight to their emotions and needs, this information can allow us to empathise and communicate better with others.
          It also helps you to be in tuned with yourself and encourage us to set goals and make conscious decisions that are good for our well-being.
