    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>First - What are HTML elements</h2>
      <p>
        An HTML element is part of an HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) document
        which tells a webpage how to structure itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some elements include headers, paragraphs, text and images.<br />
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is a style sheet language used to style
        elements in HTML documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS can be used to <b>style</b> (control) things like the font, colour,
        size of text, spacing and positioning of certains elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS selectors are used to identify certain HTML elements which you want
        to style.
      </p>
      <h2>What are ID selectors?</h2>
      <p>
        ID attributes allows you to select a single HTML element and modify it
        with styles using CSS.<br />
        IDs are unique and only targets a specific element within a page and it
        is identified with a hash symbol followed with the ID name.
      </p>
      <h3>Example of an ID selector in action:</h3>
      <p>HTML code - ID</p>
      <img class="htmlcssphoto" src="/mediaforblog/id-1.png" />
      <p>CSS code - ID</p>
      <img class="htmlcssphoto" src="/mediaforblog/id-2.png" />
      <p>What you see!</p>
      <img class="htmlcssphoto" src="mediaforblog/id-3.png" />

      <h2>What are class selectors?</h2>

      <p>
        Class are reusable styles that can be added to multiple HTML element in
        a page. <br />It is written with a period followed with the class name.
      </p>
      <h3>Example of a Class selector in action:</h3>
      <p>HTML code - Class</p>
      <img class="htmlcssphoto" src="/mediaforblog/class-1.png" />
      <p>CSS code - Class</p>
      <img class="htmlcssphoto" src="/mediaforblog/class-2.png" />
      <p>What you see!</p>
      <img class="htmlcssphoto" src="mediaforblog/class-3.png" />

      <h2>
        What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Classes should be used if there is multiple element which requires the
        same style to be used more than once within a page or website.
      </p>
      <p>
        ID should be used when you only have one element on the page that is
        going to take on the style and can't be used more than once.
      </p>
      <p>
        As IDs are also more specific because they only target a single element,
        they have a higher importance in CSS and take precedence over classes.
