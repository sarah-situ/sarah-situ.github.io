        Reflection<br />
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        - Not shying away with talking about things that I'm not good at or
        struggling with. Acknowledging to others that this is learning is
        challenging and I'm always in the state of "I don't know" but also know
        that it's a normal feeling and I'm in the learning phase where there is
        so much I don't actually know. Also feel happy that I've retained a few
        things in such a short period of time.

        <br />
        - My focus isn't great, but I'm trying to change that and I've been
        implementing the pomodoro technique which has been really good.<br />
        - I'm not very good at recognising when I'm tired and burnt out. Need to
        work on being more aware of my state of well-being.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        - My values influence what I consider important in my programming
        learning journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Being self-aware, especially during this busy period, is crucial to
        understanding my needs and how I can support and motivate myself during
        this significant learning phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Empathy involves understanding and being aware of others' feelings. It
        ties in with problem-solving. In the real world, we identify problems
        people face and help develop solutions. It's beneficial to relate to
        others by putting yourself in their shoes.
      </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        The core learning involves more than just learning how to communicate
        with others. It's also about self-awareness, understanding your values,
        identity, and learning style. Knowing yourself well aids in
        comprehending how your communication style can be applied to understand
        others.
      </p>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I think one of the most challenging part of the core learning is sharing
        about myself on the blog. Putting time aside to reflecting about what is
        important to me, what my values are, and being vulnerable. I think we
        all know to a certain extent of who we are but trying to put that onto
        paper/ text in a way to reflect how you see yourself is different. To
        express yourself in a way where you feel seen and understood, it is
        challenging, especially if you don't like talking about yourself.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It is important to focus on core learning because to be able to interact
        and communicate well is an essential soft skill that is required in a
        workplace and other settings. We might not know always have the
        technical knowledge but to be able to work well in a team, engage with
        others is essential in a workplace.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The core learning has definitely help me on my learning journey so far.
        I have better habits to help me focus throughout the day and creating a
        better framework in how I approach problems. Learning about the
        neuroplasticity and growth mindset helped me see things in a different
        way. To learn something new is possible at any age and while something
        is difficult, we shouldn't stop because we're not getting it right away.
        Good things take time and it's just a matter of when. The core learning
        has made me more self aware in my learning approach. While I could've
        spent that time learning more programming, core learning has helped me
        develop good habits and skills that I can utilise to help me gain more
        knowledge and tackle challenges.
